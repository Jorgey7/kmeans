The neural network performs exceedingly well on all data sets. With a split of
80% training data and 20% testing data, the neural network is able to achieve 
accuracy in the high 90's. The network also runs quite quickly. The speed is 
on par with kmeans and much faster than k_nearest_neighbor. The accurracy 
achieved is also either on par or much better than that achieved by kmeans. 
The iris dataset accuracy is only slightly better than kmeans, but the wine 
dataset is much more accurate. The sms dataset accuracy is also improved 
significantly. The neural network has shown to be a significantly better in 
all aspects when compared to previous clustering algorithms.
