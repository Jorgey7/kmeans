The kmeans algorithm runs in much less time than that of the k nearest neighbor algorithm. However, kmeans accuracy
results are random, whereas the accuracy results of k nearest neighbor are consistent. On top of this, k nearest
neighbor accuracy is significantly higher than even the high end of the random accuracy of the kmeans implementation.

The submitted k nearest neighbor implementation has an accuracy that places in the middle fo the pack compared to the
classifiers and tokenizers that were tested in the paper. This is approximately what was expected due to the choice
of tokenization and baselining in this implementation.
